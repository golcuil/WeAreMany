# RISKS — Active risks & mitigations

## R-001 Identity leak attempts in user text
- Risk: Users share phone/email/@handles leading to re-identification.
- Mitigation: detect -> strip -> rewrite; block repeated attempts; rate limits; safety event logging without raw text.

## R-002 Social graph inference via metadata
- Risk: timestamps/IDs/ordering reveal relationships.
- Mitigation: non-guessable IDs, coarsened times, no sender info, no correlation-friendly logs.
- Owner: CTO + DataEngineer
- Status: OPEN

## R-003 Abuse / spam flood
- Risk: bots hammer submit endpoints or attempt scraping.
- Mitigation: per-user/IP/device throttles in Redis; anomaly alerts; penalties.
